;function implementing the Collatz conjecture
;The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n.
;Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.
;Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
;The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
